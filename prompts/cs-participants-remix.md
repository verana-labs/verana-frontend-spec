# Permission Management

Rebuild the Credential Schema page:

1. Remove the "Back to Ecosystem info" and replace it with a breadcrumbs, similar to the one in the "Participants" page:

- ecosystem name
- the credential schema title

2.  Remove the "My Permissions" section

3. Keep exactly the same "Indfos" card, with just one change: on the left of the "Edit" button, put the same grantee icon we have in the permission cards with the number of grantees and the number of pending tasks.
