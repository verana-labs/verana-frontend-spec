create the Manage DIDs page.

- Search by DID substring only; show saved autocomplete of previous successful searches.
- Table with columns (desktop): DID, Controller, Created, Modified, Expire, Deposit.
- Progressive column removal on narrow screens in this order: Created, Deposit, Controller, Modified (keep DID & Expire).
- Client-side pagination & column sorting.
- Use color label for expire date: red (expired), yellow (close to expire), green (far to expire)
Row click -> DID Info.

DID Info actions:
- Renew (input number of years), Touch (no input), Remove (no input) (accordion per action)
- Each action triggers Transaction Popup.
- Above each action button, a message: You'll need approx. 5.900000 VNA to complete the transaction.
Add DID screen:
- input DID, number of years (1-10) with message: You'll need approx. 5.900000 VNA to complete the transaction, CANCEL/CONFIRM and success routing back to DID Info.
States: success, error, pending (with Mintscan link).


Create a reusable TransactionPopup component in 4 states:
- Broadcasting: “Your transaction {description} is being broadcast to the network.”
- Processing: “Your transaction {description} is being processed” with {tx_hash} link to explorer.
- Success: green success with action details, disappear automatically after 5 seconds.
- Error: red error with retry, must clear manually by hitting "X".

Transaction Popup states:
1) Broadcasting: "Your transaction {description} is being broadcast to the network."
2) Processing: show tx hash and link to explorer.
3) Success: green state with action summary.
4) Error: red state with error text and retry/dismiss.

Transaction popup must appear on the top right just below the header, when active it must always be shown including if I scroll.
