Design Trust Registries list with same responsive table rules as DIDs.

Columns:
- Id: integer
- DID: DID
- Controller: address
- Created: date
- Modified: date
- EGF (content is always an icon with a link to an external resource)

Trust Registry Info:
- Basic info view with "edit" icon that switches to inline edit mode (primary language immutable note).
- EGF Document: Add new doc (download + digest notice), list versions, Set active version flow.
- Credential Schemas: list; New schema two-step form; View schema (permissions hidden for now).

Add consistent “Back to list” affordances that respect session filters.

Create New Trust Registry form:
- On CONFIRM: step shows download of Governance Framework doc, then shows digest_sri computed notice before broadcast (UX placeholder), then Transaction Popup.
